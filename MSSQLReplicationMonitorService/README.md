MSSQL ReplicationMonitor Service
=================

The MSSQL ReplicationMonitor Service is a lightweight Windows Service to provide MSSQL Replication information over HTTP. It uses [WebAPI](http://www.asp.net/web-api) to provide the HTTP component and is built as a [Debuggable Self-installable Windows Service](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/archive/2011/03/01/c-toolbox-debug-able-self-installable-windows-service-template-redux.aspx) for easy deployment and debugging.
